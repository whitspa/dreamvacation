 ## Description:
 This application allows users to plan their activities at our fabulous resort! We used React for the front end, and GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server. The database is MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM. We used queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data. The site is deployed to heroku. (see link at bottom of README)
